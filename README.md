# SoundTrek

A decentralized app for creating audio diaries with location-based soundscapes using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

SoundTrek is a platform that enables users to create, share, and discover location-based audio content through a decentralized infrastructure. The platform allows creators to maintain ownership of their content while providing listeners with immersive audio experiences tied to specific locations around the world.

## Core Features

- Create and manage audio diaries with geographic metadata
- Monetize premium audio content through subscriptions and one-time purchases 
- Social discovery system for finding and sharing location-based audio experiences
- Follow creators and rate content
- Create and share playlists and recommendations

## Smart Contract Architecture

The platform consists of three main smart contracts:

### sound-trek-core
Manages the fundamental audio diary functionality:
- Creating and storing audio entries with location data
- Managing access control for private content
- Handling geographic metadata and permissions

### sound-trek-marketplace
Enables content monetization features:
- One-time purchases of premium content
- Subscription-based access to creator content
- Refund functionality for eligible purchases
- Platform fee management

### sound-trek-social
Provides social and discovery features:
- Follow relationships between users
- Content rating and listening statistics
- Playlist creation and management
- Location-based content discovery
- Sharing recommendations

## Key Functions

### Content Creation & Management
```clarity
;; Create new audio diary entry
(create-entry 
    (title (string-utf8 100))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (audio-url (string-utf8 256))
    (latitude int)
    (longitude int)
    (is-public bool))

;; Update existing entry
(update-entry
    (entry-id uint)
    (title (string-utf8 100))
    (description (string-utf8 500))
    (audio-url (string-utf8 256))
    (latitude int)
    (longitude int)
    (is-public bool))
```

### Monetization
```clarity
;; Purchase one-time access to content
(purchase-content (content-id uint))

;; Subscribe to creator content
(subscribe-to-content (content-id uint) (auto-renew bool))
```

### Social Features
```clarity
;; Follow a creator
(follow-creator (creator principal))

;; Rate content
(rate-content (content-id uint) (rating uint))

;; Create playlist
(create-playlist 
    (name (string-utf8 100))
    (description (optional (string-utf8 500)))
    (public bool))
```

## Getting Started

To interact with the SoundTrek platform:

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize user profile using `create-or-update-profile`
3. Begin creating audio content with `create-entry`
4. Set up monetization options via the marketplace contract
5. Engage with the community through the social features

## Security Considerations

- Access control is enforced at the contract level for private content
- Monetary transactions include checks for sufficient funds and valid pricing
- Geographic coordinates are validated before storage
- Platform fees are managed through secure admin functions
- All data mutations require appropriate authorization

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced geographic search capabilities
- Content curation and featured playlists
- Enhanced monetization models
- Community governance features
- Integration with external audio platforms
